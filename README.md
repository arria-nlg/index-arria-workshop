# Index IBM/Arria Workshop

A node.js webapp to be used in the Arria workshop.

During this workshop users will learn:

* Load and retrieve data from the Investment Portfolio service
* Send portfolio data to the Instrument Analytics service to retrieve analytics
* Use Arria Studio to publish a RESTful API to digest portfolio data and create a narrative on your investments through the IBM Cloud service
* Send the portfolio data to your Arria API to generate the narrative.

## Included Components
+ Bluemix Investment Portfolio
+ Bluemix Instrument Analytics
+ Arria NLG

# Automatically Deploying the Application to IBM Cloud

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https://github.com/robert-hodgson1/predictive-market-using-arria.git)

Be sure to [load investment portfolio](#5-load-investment-portfolio) before running the application.

# Manually Deploying the Application to IBM Cloud
Follow these steps to setup and run this pattern. The steps are described in detail below.

## Prerequisite
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Steps
1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create Bluemix services](#2-create-bluemix-services)
3. [Sign up to Arria Studio and publish your API](#3-sign-up-to-Arria)
4. [Configure .env file](#4-configure-env-file)
5. [Load Investment Portfolio](#5-load-investment-portfolio)
6. [Run Application](#6-run-application)
7. [Deploy to IBM Cloud](#7-deploy-to-ibm-cloud)


## 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `Predict Market Using Arria repo` locally. In a terminal, run:

  `$ git clone https://github.com/XXXX/index-arria-workshop.git`


## 2. Create Bluemix services

Create the following services in IBM Cloud:

* [**Investment Portfolio**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/investment-portfolio)
* [**Instrument Analytics**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/instrument-analytics)
* [**Arria Natural Language Generation APIs**](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-generation-apis)

<br>For the `Arria Natural Language Generation API` service, you will need to register go to step 3 to generate the url and token to place into the service.

## 3. Sign up to Arria

Sign up - load the template, pulbish the API - get the URL and token.
set the url and token in the service in bluemix??

## 4. Configure .env file

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your clone of the project repository by copying the sample `.env.example` file using the following command:

  ```none
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

  **NOTE** Most files systems regard files with a "." at the front as hidden files.  If you are on a Windows system, you should be able to use either [GitBash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) or [Xcopy](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/xcopy.mspx?mfr=true)

You will need to update the credentials with the Bluemix credentials for each of the services you created in [Step 2](#2-create-bluemix-services).

The `.env` file will look something like the following:

  ```none  
  # Investment Portfolio
  CRED_PORTFOLIO_USERID_W=
  CRED_PORTFOLIO_PWD_W=
  CRED_PORTFOLIO_USERID_R=
  CRED_PORTFOLIO_PWD_R=
  CRED_PORTFOLIO_URL=

  # Instrument Analytics
  CRED_INSTRUMENT_ANALYTICS_URL=
  CRED_INSTRUMENT_ANALYTICS_ACCESSTOKEN=

  # Arria Natural Language Generation
  CRED_ARRIA_NATURAL_LANGUAGE_GENERATION_URL=
  CRED_ARRIA_NATURAL_LANGUAGE_GENERATION_TOKEN=
  ```

## 4. Load Investment Portfolio

You will now need to create a portfolio in your Investment Portfolio service and create holdings for that portfolio. The `holdings.sample.json` file provides you with sample holdings for a portfolio.  You can run the `investmentPortfolio.js` script to load portfolio and holdings.  The credentials are retrieved from `.env` file so ensure that your Investment Portfolio credentials are filled as per the [last step](#3-configure-env-file).

To load a portfolio named `MyFixedIncomePortfolio`, first install dependencies and use the command-line with the script to create the portfolio:
```
npm install
node investmentPortfolio.js -l MyFixedIncomePortfolio
```

To load holdings from `holdings.sample.json` into `MyFixedIncomePortfolio`, run:
```
node investmentPortfolio.js -l MyFixedIncomePortfolio -h holdings.sample.json
```

Similarly you can view your portfolios by running:
```
node investmentPortfolio.js -g
```

and view holdings for portfolio:
```
node investmentPortfolio.js -g MyFixedIncomePortfolio
```


## 5. Run Application

cd into this project's root directory
+ Run `npm install` to install the app's dependencies
+ Run `node app.js`
+ Access the running app locally


## 6. Deploy to IBM Cloud

Edit the `manifest.yml` file in the folder that contains your code and replace with a unique name for your application. The name that you specify determines the application's URL, such as `your-application-name.mybluemix.net`. Additionally - update the service names so they match what you have in Bluemix. The relevant portion of the `manifest.yml` file looks like the following:

  ```none
  applications:
  - path: .
    memory: 256M
    instances: 1
    domain: mybluemix.net
    name: arria-predictive-market
    host: arria-predictive-market
    disk_quota: 256M
    buildpack: sdk-for-nodejs
    services:
    - Investment-Portfolio
    - Instrument-Analytics
    - Arria-NLG-1
  ```

Once the manfiest.yml file is configured, you can push to IBM Cloud. From your root directory login into cf:
```
cf login
```
And push the app to IBM Cloud:
```
cf push
```

# Troubleshooting

* To troubleshoot your Bluemix application, use the logs. To see the logs, run:

```bash
cf logs <application-name> --recent
```
